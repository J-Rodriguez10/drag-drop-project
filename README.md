This simple project was part of Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller's [Typescript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/?couponCode=ST4MT73124) on Udemy! <br>
In this project, you can create a project which will first appear in the "Active Project" list. <br> You can then drag and drop the project into the "Finished Project" list.<br>
